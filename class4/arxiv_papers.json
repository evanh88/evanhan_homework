        "summary": "In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,\nachieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance\nbeing quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but\nmore challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely\non expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags\nsignificantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for\ntransforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between\nopen-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To\nmitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General\nIntelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped\nwith general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze\nmultiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nmodel with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,\ncontinually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from\nscientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and\nthen online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose\nMixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks\nsimultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and\ntraining systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL\ntraining.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates\ncompetitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and\nsignificantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing\nclosed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular\nsynthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic\nstabilities for crystals.

While the Model Context Protocol\n(MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is\na significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve\nmulti-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In\nthis work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated\nreal-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,\nthat require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file\noperations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a\nnovel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather\nthan raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world\nenvironments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate\nbelow 60\\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed\nablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and\ninefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing\ncurrent models.

We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel\nframework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently\noptimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual\ngradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization\nby providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration\ninterdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that\nproposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an\nOptimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving\nfeedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT\ndemonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,\nachieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.",

However, they often fall\nshort in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)\nhas emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning\nprocess. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning\nability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the\nmodel's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We\nintroduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse\nreasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various\ndomains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost\n(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning\nefficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models\nconsistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and\nnon-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as\nevidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more\nstreamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of\nTIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.",

        "summary": "Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by\nknowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,\nbut their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor\nfeedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce\nDeep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement\nlearning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for\nmedical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical\nretrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge\nsources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More\ncrutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its\nenvironment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,\nand diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from\nlarge-scale data through RL.\n  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework\nconsistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches\nacross multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves\nsubstantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic\nbaselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks\nfor both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and\nretrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the\nuniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional\nimplementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight\nimprovements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight\ninto its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more\nreliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

However, this raises an important question:\ndo these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes\nintroduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in\nboth scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this\nquestion. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal\nmultitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.\nEcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8\nessential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.\nAnalysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve\nperformance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may\nstruggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.\nBuilding on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that\nstrategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before\nusing them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/submission25.",

Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in\nlanguage analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages\nlike Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by\nsignificantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.\nThis paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing\nthe importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring\nthe landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a\nsignificant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the\ndiscontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible\nimplementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation\nmethodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of\nBangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the\nchallenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions\nfor Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla\nstemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and\nprocessing.",

Pos2Distill transfers\nthe superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,\nthereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to\nleverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.\nWe identify distinct manifestations of PB under \\textbf{\\textsc{r}}etrieval and\n\\textbf{\\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized\ninstantiations: \\emph{Pos2Distill-R\\textsuperscript{1}} and\n\\emph{Pos2Distill-R\\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this\ncore principle.

While large language models (LLMs)\noffer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area\nis hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.\nTo address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new\nbenchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science\ndomain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a\ntopic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited\nreferences, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers\nthat serves as the retrieval pool.

In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can\nmore effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend\nagainst them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the\nmodel's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we\npropose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement\nlearning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities\nas a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative\nself-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or\nexternal models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and\ntraining-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.\nBy aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings\nrobust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This\nalignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling\nthe model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small\namount of discriminative samples.

For instance, automated annotations\nunderestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\\%,\npotentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further\nshow that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of\neffect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof\nsolution.

Despite its significance, understanding of how much\nprivacy risk these language models possess and how it can be mitigated is still\nlimited. This research addresses this by providing a comprehensive study of the\nprivacy-preserving language modeling approaches. This study gives an in-depth\noverview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates\ntheir limitations. The outcomes of this study contribute to the ongoing\nresearch on privacy-preserving language modeling, providing valuable insights\nand outlining future research directions.",

Unlike in the vision-language\ndomain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model\nweights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To\naddress these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,\nend-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides\nthe community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance\nspeech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task\ninstruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for\nstandardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release\nLLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public\ndata. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,\nreproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals\nthat while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant\ngeneralization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio\nscenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,\nLLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and\naccelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,\npretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.",

Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source\nof the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the\nlanguage model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and\noptimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,\nformalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce\nthis complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so\nfurther growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A\nword-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce\ncross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most\nfrequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and\noutput embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance\nreverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers\nfrom imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in\ndownstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show\nthat enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same\nfrequent-word benefit. Our results reframe \"bigger vocabularies help\" as\n\"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps,\" providing a simple,\nprincipled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics\nthat govern language-model scaling in pre-training.",

        "summary": "While neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown high effectiveness, they remain\nsusceptible to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we introduce Few-Shot\nAdversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages\nthe in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to\ngenerate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that\nrely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents,\nFSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting,\nrequiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning\nthe LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP\nsynthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly\nembed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic\ncontent. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful\nexamples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which\nenables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across\nunrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health\nMisinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that\nFSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate\ndocuments. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that these adversarial\noutputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a\nrealistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also\neffectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.",

In this work, we investigate the capacity\nof LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple\nexperimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal\ncommonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine\ntemporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from\nSAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing\nand achieves over 80\\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense.

To\ntackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation\n(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor\nencodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through\ngrounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern\nunreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward\nthe more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE\neffectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average\nperformance gain of 5.0\\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a\npromising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.",

        "summary": "Recent studies have shown that recommender systems (RSs) are highly\nvulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious actors inject fake user\nprofiles, including a group of well-designed fake ratings, to manipulate\nrecommendations. Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers\ntypically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft\nprofiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack\nimpact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such\nhigh-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works\nsuggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the\npoor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and\nimperceptibility under the practical setting.\n  To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the\nquality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities\nof multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration\nretrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie\nICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to\ngenerate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the\nrobustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and\ncollaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve\nthe attack transferability and imperceptibility.

A substantial portion of SLMs' memory\nfootprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and\nlanguage modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static\nvocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,\none-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage\nand a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles\nunderlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,\nthe observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any\nsingle inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between\nvocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce\nVocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that\naddresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a\nhybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling\non-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across\ndiverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of\nup to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or\nno degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static\nvocabulary pruning.",
